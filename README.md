# LED Intensity Controller

This project implements an **LED Intensity Controller** using a microcontroller, designed as part of the ENSF 460 course at the Schulich School of Engineering (Fall 2024). It showcases real-time control of LED brightness using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), push button inputs, and potentiometer adjustments. Additionally, it features UART communication for logging data to a PC, with Python scripts for data visualization.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **ON/OFF Control** (PB1):
  - Toggle LED system on/off.
  - Adjust brightness dynamically using a potentiometer in ON mode.
- **Blink Mode** (PB2):
  - Blink LED at adjustable intensity (ON mode) or full intensity (OFF mode).
  - Toggle blinking with a second press.
- **Data Logging** (PB3):
  - Transmit LED intensity levels and ADC readings via UART.
  - Generate a CSV log and graphical plots with a Python script.

### Technical Highlights
- **Finite State Machine (FSM)**: Power-efficient design with state-driven transitions.
- **Python Visualization**: CSV logging and graphical analysis of intensity levels and ADC readings.
- **Interrupt-Driven Design**: Ensures real-time responsiveness and low power consumption.

## Technologies Used
- **C Programming**: Firmware development with MPLAB X IDE and XC16 Compiler.
- **Python**: Data logging and visualization using:
  - `pyserial` for UART communication.
  - `pandas` and `matplotlib` for data processing and plotting.
- **UART Communication**: Serial data transfer between microcontroller and PC.

## How to Use

### Microcontroller Setup
1. Clone this repository and open the project in MPLAB X IDE.
2. Connect the hardware components as per the documentation.
3. Compile and upload the firmware to your microcontroller.
4. Power on the microcontroller.

### Python Data Logger
1. Open `VoltageADCPlotter.py` and configure the serial port settings:
   ```python
   PORT = 'COM5'  # Adjust to your system
   BAUD_RATE = 4800
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python VoltageADCPlotter.py
   ```
3. Press PB3 on the hardware to start data transmission.
4. View the generated CSV file and plots in the `/logging` folder.

## Output Files
- **CSV File**: 
  - Format: `Group_26.csv`
  - Columns: `index`, `timestamp`, `intensity_level`, `adc_reading`
- **Plots**:
  - Intensity vs. Time
  - ADC Readings vs. Time

## Troubleshooting

### LED Issues
- **No Response**:
  - Verify connection to pin 12.
  - Check 1kΩ resistor and ground connections.
- **Flickering**:
  - Ensure PWM frequency is set appropriately.

### Data Logging Issues
- **No Data Received**:
  - Verify the correct COM port is selected.
  - Confirm UART baud rate matches.
- **Script Errors**:
  - Ensure required Python libraries are installed.

### Button Responsiveness
- **Unresponsive Buttons**:
  - Check connections and interrupts.
  - Verify proper button debouncing implementation.
